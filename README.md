# pwa_first_app
A PWA bike app that psychologically makes me feel good about biking 30 miles a day

## Technically this has nothing to do with biking directly
This is a simple app that adds/subtracts $30 from a total value. You see currently for my commute to work, since I don't have a car, I either bike 30 miles or pay $60. The rides aren't too bad really, listen to podcasts, still it's brutal, that's 150 miles a week or 15hrs on my piece of crap WalMart bike.

## About the app
This is my first PWA, I'm going to go through some articles/tutorials/SO questions and what not and then build it. My main goals are offline persistence of the UI and offline data storage. Then the session handling will have to happen since I don't want to have my data be shared/the public change my values.

I'll be writing a Medium article series on this, just a little feel good thing I do every now and then. Too bad if you're the reader, I'm trying to make it better, less of my crap. Though they're not tutorials either, more of a log of me doing something.

## Progress

### 07-30-2018 7:35 PM
This is a working basic, mobile-first app. Literally two buttons that when tapped add or subtract 30 and update a display however currently has no persistence. The repo works as I want to work on this project from different devices and I'm like "Doh! It's on my desktop"
